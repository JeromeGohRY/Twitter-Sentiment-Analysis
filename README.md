This project focuses on the application of LSTMs for sentiment analysis. The LSTM model is trained using word embeddings from the `GloVe.twitter.27B.50d.txt` dataset. The LSTM model takes a tweet as an input and outputs the sentiment of the tweet in the form of probabilities. The sentiments are categorized as positive, negative, or neutral. After training the LSTM model, its performance is compared with TextBlob API and Twitter-roBERTa-base for Sentiment Analysis.
